Servlet

Java servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, 
consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web
 server and for accessing existing business systems.
 Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate
 responses (typically HTML pages) to requests (typically HTTP requests) 
from clients.

The Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded by two 
standard Java technologies for web services:

the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0)
useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and
the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services.
