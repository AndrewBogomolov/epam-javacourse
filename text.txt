Java is a general-purpose programming 
that is class-based, object-oriented, 
and designed to have as few implementation
dependencies as possible. It is intended 
to let application developers write once, 
run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled 
Java code can run on all platforms that support 
Java without the need for recompilation.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode 
that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming 
languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for 
client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
