Java is a general-purpose programming 
that is class-based, object-oriented, 
and designed to have as few implementation
dependencies as possible. It is intended 
to let application developers write once, 
run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled 
Java code can run on all platforms that support 
Java without the need for recompilation.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode 
that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming 
languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for 
client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

Editions

Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java 
targeting different application environments and segmented 
many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. 
The platforms are:

Java Card for smart-cards.
Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) – targeting environments 
with limited resources.
Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) – targeting workstation 
environments
Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – targeting large 
distributed enterprise or Internet environments.
The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups 
called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces,
classes, and exceptions. Refer to the separate platforms 
for a description of the packages available.

Sun also provided an edition called Personal Java 
that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME 
configuration-profile pairings.
